	<string name="theIntroduction">Introduction</string>
	<string name="introBasics">Let\'s learn some basics.</string>
	<string name="introIntro">Your journey begins here.</string>
	<string name="choosePieceDesign">It\'s important that you can tell your pieces apart, so make sure you choose the right piece set.
To do that click on the cog wheel or your username(top right corner) and then click on \'piece set\'.</string>
	<string name="promotionZone">When some of your pieces reach or leave the first three ranks in your opponent\'s territory you can choose to promote your piece and make it stronger.</string>
	<string name="senteGoesFirst">In shogi the player who goes first is called sente and the player who goes second is called gote. Sente is sometimes represented by black color and gote by white. Make any move as sente to continue.</string>

	<string name="rookGoal">Pindutin ang rook para ipunta ito sa bituin!</string>
	<string name="rookPromotion">The rook promotes to the powerful dragon. Don\'t forget that you can also promote your piece when you leave the promotion zone.</string>
	<string name="rookSummary">The rook can go up, down, left or right as much as it wants.</string>
	<string name="dragonSummary">It can move just like the unpromoted rook, but also one square in any diagonal direction, making it much stronger.</string>
	<string name="grabAllTheStars">Kunin lahat ng bituin!</string>

	<string name="itMovesDiagonally">Ito ay gumagalaw ng pahalang</string>
	<string name="bishopIntro">Next we will learn how to manoeuvre a bishop!</string>
	<string name="bishopPromotion">Promoting your bishop will make it stronger, it will turn into a piece called \"the horse\".</string>
	<string name="bishopSummary">The bishop moves in any diagonal direction.</string>
	<string name="horseSummary">The promoted bishop moves also diagonally, but it can also go one square up, down, left or right as well.</string>
	<string name="bishopComplete">Congratulations! You can command a bishop.</string>
	<string name="theKing">Ang king</string>
	<string name="theMostImportantPiece">Ang pinakaimportanteng piyesa</string>

	<string name="knightsCanJumpOverObstacles">Knights can jump over obstacles!</string>
	<string name="knightSummary">The knight can jump in an L shape forward, but only by two squares forward and one square sideways. Its movement also isn\'t restricted by other pieces - it will just jump over them.</string>
	<string name="pknightSummary">Promoted knight moves are completely different from the unpromoted knight, but you can notice it moves the same as the gold general, so make sure to study that one thoroughly.</string>
