	<string name="knightsCanJumpOverObstacles">Knights can jump over obstacles!</string>

of every game of shogi!
Make any move to continue.</string>
	<string name="firstPlaceTheKing">There are two traditional ways of setting up pieces before a game. We will be teaching the Oohashi (大橋) style, most commonly used by professionals. The king goes first. Move the king to the back rank’s center square.</string>

	<string name="placeTheBishopThenRook">Place the bishop above the left knight, then the rook above the right knight. Of course, in real games there is no need to be in sync with your opponent during setup.</string>

	<string name="pushingThe3rdPawn">Pushing the 3rd pawn to open the bishop’s diagonal is the most common first move. Make this move to continue.</string>

Unfortunately for your opponent, they don\'t know that! Make the only legal move.</string>
	<string name="boardFlippedFindBestMove">The board was just flipped. What is the best move here?</string>
